# SCviewer
A minimal, Chromium-based desktop viewer designed for distraction-free full-screen or tiled video streaming from Stripchat and similar sites, with no intrusive browser UI. It supports optional height-fit zoom for streams, basic keyboard-only control, multi-window layouts, and persistent session state.
Built with Electron, it prioritizes a clean, focused viewing experience over traditional browser features.
